Feature: Login

As a merchant
I want to login to the management console
so that I can configure my service

I can write lots of text here and it will be like a live functional specification document.

Scenario: Valid login
    Given I enter a valid username and password on the login page
    When I click submit
    Then I will have access to configure my service
